### Order a Product

> **Note:** These are examples. Add your own products to the *Product* table.

To make it easier to add multiple products, when the user selects a product to order, display the menu of products again. Make sure the last option of *Back to main menu* so the user can specify that no more products are needed.

2. Case of Cracking Cola

...
9. Back to main menu
```

### Complete an Order

##### If no products have been selected yet
```bash
Please add some products to your order first. Press any key to return to main menu.
```

##### If there are current products in an order
```bash
Your order total is $149.54. Ready to purchase

# If user entered Y

Your order is complete! Press any key to return to main menu.

# If user entered N, display the main menu again
```

Once the order is complete, show the main menu again, where the user can start creating another order.
